          <h1>Block Chain</h1>
          <p>
            Blockchain, sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology
            (DLT), makes the history of any digital asset unalterable and
            transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic
            hashing. A simple analogy for understanding blockchain technology
            is a Google Doc. When we create a document and share it with a
            group of people, the document is distributed instead of copied or
            transferred. This creates a decentralized distribution chain that
            gives everyone access to the document at the same time. No one is
            locked out awaiting changes from another party, while all
            modifications to the doc are being recorded in real-time, making
            changes completely transparent.
            <br />
            Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology
            because it helps reduce risk, stamps out fraud and brings
            transparency in a scaleable way for myriad uses.
            <br />
            <br />
            Blockchain consists of three important concepts: blocks, nodes and
            miners.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Blocks :</b>
            Every chain consists of multiple blocks and each block has three
            basic elements:
            <br />
            <br />-The data in the block. <br />-A 32-bit whole number called
            a nonce. The nonce is randomly generated when a block is created,
            which then generates a block header hash. <br />-The hash is a
            256-bit number wedded to the nonce. It must start with a huge
            number of zeroes (i.e., be extremely small). <br />When the first
            block of a chain is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic
            hash. The data in the block is considered signed and forever tied
            to the nonce and hash unless it is mined.<br /><br />
            <b>Miners:</b> <br />Miners create new blocks on the chain through
            a process called mining. <br />In a blockchain every block has its
            own unique nonce and hash, but also references the hash of the
            previous block in the chain, so mining a block isn't easy,
            especially on large chains.<br /><br />
            Miners use special software to solve the incredibly complex math
            problem of finding a nonce that generates an accepted hash.
            Because the nonce is only 32 bits and the hash is 256, there are
            roughly four billion possible nonce-hash combinations that must be
            mined before the right one is found. When that happens miners are
            said to have found the "golden nonce" and their block is added to
            the chain. <br /><br />Making a change to any block earlier in the
            chain requires re-mining not just the block with the change, but
            all of the blocks that come after. This is why it's extremely
            difficult to manipulate blockchain technology. Think of it is as
            "safety in math" since finding golden nonces requires an enormous
            amount of time and computing power.<br /><br />
            When a block is successfully mined, the change is accepted by all
            of the nodes on the network and the miner is rewarded financially.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Nodes:</b>
            <br />
            One of the most important concepts in blockchain technology is
            decentralization. No one computer or organization can own the
            chain. Instead, it is a distributed ledger via the nodes connected
            to the chain. Nodes can be any kind of electronic device that
            maintains copies of the blockchain and keeps the network
            functioning.<br /><br />
            Every node has its own copy of the blockchain and the network must
            algorithmically approve any newly mined block for the chain to be
            updated, trusted and verified. Since blockchains are transparent,
            every action in the ledger can be easily checked and viewed. Each
            participant is given a unique alphanumeric identification number
            that shows their transactions.

          <h1>Data Science</h1>
          <p>
            Data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific
            methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge
            and insights from structured and unstructured data and apply
            knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range
            of application domains. Data science is related to data mining,
            machine learning and big data.Data science is a "concept to unify
            statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods"
            in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.
            <br /><br />It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields
            within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science,
            information science, and domain knowledge. Turing award winner Jim
            Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science
            (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and
            asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the
            impact of information technology" and the data deluge.
            <br /><br />
            Data science involves a plethora of disciplines and expertise
            areas to produce a holistic, thorough and refined look into raw
            data. Data scientists must be skilled in everything from data
            engineering, math, statistics, advanced computing and
            visualizations to be able to effectively sift through muddled
            masses of information and communicate only the most vital bits
            that will help drive innovation and efficiency.
            <br />
            <br />
            Data scientists also rely heavily on artificial intelligence,
            especially its subfields of machine learning and deep learning, to
            create models and make predictions using algorithms and other
            techniques. <br /><br />
            <b>Data Science Uses:</b>
            <br /><br />
            <b>Healthcare</b><br />
            Data science has led to a number of breakthroughs in the
            healthcare industry. With a vast network of data now available via
            everything from EMRs to clinical databases to personal fitness
            trackers, medical professionals are finding new ways to understand
            disease, practice preventive medicine, diagnose diseases faster
            and explore new treatment options.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Self-Driving Cars</b>
            <br />
            Tesla, Ford and Volkswagen are all implementing predictive
            analytics in their new wave of autonomous vehicles. These cars use
            thousands of tiny cameras and sensors to relay information in
            real-time. Using machine learning, predictive analytics and data
            science, self-driving cars can adjust to speed limits, avoid
            dangerous lane changes and even take passengers on the quickest
            route. <br /><br />
            <b>Logistics</b>

            <br />
            UPS turns to data science to maximize efficiency, both internally
            and along its delivery routes. The companyâ€™s On-road Integrated
            Optimization and Navigation (ORION) tool uses data science-backed
            statistical modeling and algorithms that create optimal routes for
            delivery drivers based on weather, traffic, construction, etc.
            Itâ€™s estimated that data science is saving the logistics company
            up to 39 million gallons of fuel and more than 100 million
            delivery miles each year.
            <br /><br />
            <b>Finance</b><br />
            Machine learning and data science have saved the financial
            industry millions of dollars, and unquantifiable amounts of time.
            For example, JP Morganâ€™s Contract Intelligence (COiN) platform
            uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process and extract
            vital data from about 12,000 commercial credit agreements a year.
            Thanks to data science, what would take around 360,000 manual
            labor hours to complete is now finished in a few hours.
            Additionally, fintech companies like Stripe and Paypal are
            investing heavily in data science to create machine learning tools
            that quickly detect and prevent fraudulent activities.

          <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
          <p>
            Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system
            resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing
            power, without direct active management by the user.
            <br /><br />
            The term is generally used to describe data centers available to
            many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today,
            often have functions distributed over multiple locations from
            central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively
            close, it may be designated an edge server.
            <br /><br />
            Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve
            coherence and economies of scale. Advocates of public and hybrid
            clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or
            minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim
            that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications
            up and running faster, with improved manageability and less
            maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust
            resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing
            the burst computing capability: high computing power at certain
            periods of peak demand.
            <br />
          <p>
            Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves
            delivering hosted services over the internet. These services are
            divided into three main categories: infrastructure as a service
            (IaaS), platform as a service (>PaaS) and software as a service (
            SaaS).
          </p>
          <p>A cloud can be private or public. A public cloud sells services to
            anyone on the internet. A private cloud is a proprietary network or
            a data center that supplies hosted services to a limited number of
            people, with certain access and permissions settings. Private or
            public, the goal of cloud computing is to provide easy, scalable
            access to computing resources and IT services.</p>
          <p>Cloud computing works by allowing client devices to access data
            over the internet, from remote servers, databases and computers.</p>
          <p>An internet network connection links the front end (includes the
            accessing client device, browser, network and cloud software
            applications) with the back end, which consists of databases,
            servers and computers). The back end functions as a repository,
            storing data that is accessed by the front end.</p>
          <p>Communications between the front and back ends are managed by a
            central server. The central server relies on protocols to facilitate
            the exchange of data. The central server uses both software and
            middleware to manage connectivity between different client devices
            and cloud servers. Typically, there will be a dedicated server for
            each individual application.</p>
          <p><b>Examples of cloud computing include:</b></p>
          <p><strong>Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365:&nbsp;</strong>Users can
            access Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365 through the internet.
            Users can be more productive because they can access work
            presentations and spreadsheets stored in the cloud at any time from
            anywhere on any device.</p>
          <p><strong>Email, Calendar, Skype, WhatsApp:</strong>&nbsp;Emails,
            calendars, Skype and WhatsApp take advantage of the cloud's ability
            to provide users with access to data remotely so they can access
            their personal data on any device, whenever and wherever they want.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Zoom:</strong> Zoom is a cloud-based software platform for
            video and audio conferencing that records meetings and saves them to
            the cloud, enabling users to access them anywhere and at any time.
          </p>
          <p><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Lambda allows developers to run code
            for applications or back-end services without having to provision or
            manage servers. The pay-as-you-go model constantly scales with an
            organization to accommodate real-time changes in data usage and data
            storage.</p>
          <p><b> Types of Cloud Computing Services:</b></p>
          <p>As mentioned previously, cloud computing can be separated into three
          general service delivery categories:</p>
          <p><strong>Infrastructure as a service</strong>. IaaS providers, such
            as AWS, supply a&nbsp;virtual
              server</a>&nbsp;instance and storage, as well as APIs that let
            users migrate workloads to a virtual machine (VM).
            Users have an allocated storage capacity and can start, stop, access
            and configure the VM and storage as desired. IaaS providers offer
            small, medium, large, extra-large and memory- or compute-optimized
            instances, in addition to allowing customization of instances, for
            various workload needs.</p>
          <p><strong>Platform as a service</strong>. In the PaaS model, cloud
            providers host development tools on their infrastructures. Users
            access these tools over the internet using APIs, web portals&nbsp;or
            gateway software. PaaS is used for general software development, and
            many PaaS providers host the software after it's developed. Common
            PaaS providers include Salesforce's Lightning Platform, AWS Elastic
            Beanstalk and Google App Engine.</p>
          <p><strong>Software as a service</strong>. SaaS is a distribution
            model that delivers software applications over the internet; these
            applications are often called&nbsp;web
              services. Users can access SaaS applications and services from
            any location using a computer or mobile device that has internet
            access. In the SaaS model, users gain access to application software
            and databases. One common example of a SaaS application is
            Microsoft&nbsp;Office 365&nbsp;for productivity and email services.
